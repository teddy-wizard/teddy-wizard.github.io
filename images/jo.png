Total Price: 971, Hope Jo give this 971 RMB to my wife after he got the medicines and let you know.

Actually, It's hard to meet CholJun (the person in dai biao tuan), and even I did not get my photo from him until now...,
anyhow I delegated PCM to give 1st yao to CholJun, there are a lot of goods, and no room for the unexpected medicines,
also, I am not comfortable to request this to big boss.
