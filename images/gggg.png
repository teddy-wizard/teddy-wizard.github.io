To Gao:

1. leng gan mo po + fen sui ji + xi fa lu + xi fa shui = 3700 RMB (This is original goods price, no yunfei included)
2. electric things:  xiyiji + fengshan * 2 = 1700 + 1100 = 2800 RMB (Included default yunfei, costed much more, you can't imagine.) 
3. xue tang qi = 430 RMB
4. Pay #1 and #3 to my mom (You can say that I sent money through your's friend here, no need 3rd party member.)
5. For the trade goods, If you can afford to pay it to my mom / wf within a month after you got things, I can help you. This rule applies to future business. I will only charge original price + yunfei (if costed)
   I'll let you know to give to whom every time.
6. If you confirm you can do #4 this month (or maybe you already did it last year), I'll carry out cigarette business.
7. For the small things ONLY for your personal use (nobody else), I can consider as gift.
