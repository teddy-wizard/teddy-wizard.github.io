1. leng gan mo po + fen sui ji + xi fa lu + xi fa shui = 3700 RMB (This is original goods price, no yunfei included)
2. electric things:  xiyiji + fengshan * 2 = 1700 + 1100 = 2800 RMB (Included default yunfei, costed much more, you can't imagine.) 
3. xue tang qi = 430 RMB
4. Pay #1 and #3 to my mom (You can say that I sent money through your's friend here, no need 3rd party member.)
5. For the trade goods, If you can afford to pay it to my mom / wf within a month after you got things, I can help you. This rule applies to future business. I will only charge original price + yunfei (if costed)
   I'll let you know to give to whom every time.
6. If you confirm you can do #4 this month (or maybe you already did it last year), I'll carry out cigarette business.
7. For the small things ONLY for your personal use (nobody else), I can consider as gift.

To Gao:
1. If you gave $500 to my mom last year according to the feng's instruction, nothing is required to pay. 
   Just let me know the approx.date you paid to my mom.
   
2. Regard Xue Tang Qi as a gift to you. I bought it because my mom uses it and it's a good one. Later you can only buy xue tang shi zhi.
   Hope your mom feels better.

2. For the business, if the profit is that small, I think it's not worth for my and your friends (unhui and Mrs Sa) precious time. 
   I am afraid you lose good emotion to other people if you keep asking people to help you well. (Except me here :D). 
   They will only help you one time at max. It's just what I think, and you can keep asking help anyway.
